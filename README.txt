Hood
====

a tower defence type game where you play as little red riding hood who must defeat other fairy-tales to get to grandma's house.

this is currently being developed on my own for my Graphic communication/ Illustration A Level. I will continue this project on afterwards with the hope of relaeasing it by July 5th 2013. 

crap to do:
	frame rate issues
	settings menu
	variable frame limit
	shadows option
	variable rotation mode
	
	note with 288 pixel texture the frame rate drops
